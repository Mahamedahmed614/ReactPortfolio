# ReactPortfolio
This application is my first ever Reat Portfolio which is my personal webpage designed to show my future employers projects and assignments that I have created over a span of time. I used Bootstrap and was able to have a fully functional and responsive web application. Making the react portfolio was actually the most emjoyable application i've made all year, got to fully personalize my own web application and showcase the many skills i've got to point my hands on all year. Also has contact information and cant wait to send this to employers in the near future..
